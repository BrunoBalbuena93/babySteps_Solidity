- **Blockchain:**
- **Decentralized:** No central source that controls the system
- **Inmmutability:** Data cannot be edited
- **Pseaudoanonymus:**
- **Smart Contract:** Set of instructions which are executed automatically (algorithms)
- **Oracles:** Data provider for blockchains to inject external data
- **Hybrid Smart Contract:** Smart contracts wich require external data via oracles
- **DApp:**
- **DAO:** Descentralized Autonomus Assosiations
- **Testnet:** Net where you can test your code
- **Gas:** Measure of the computational use for a transaction to ocur
- **Gwei:** Measurement of a certain token (like satoshis in BTC) used to calculate the gas price (1 Gwei = 1x10^-9 ETH) 
- **Gas Price:** Amount of `tokens` needed to execute a transaction
- **Gas Limit:** Amount of gas that the transaction should be allowed to pay
- **Hash:** Unique fixed length string to identify a piece of data (transaction)
- **Nonce:** The solution number to meet the requirements of the hashing difficulty in the blockchain
- **PoW:** Proof of Work mining algorithm
- **PoS:** Proof of Stake mining algorithm
- **Consensus:** Mechanism used to agree on the state of a blockchain
- **Nakamoto Consensus:** *The blockchain follows the longest chain*
