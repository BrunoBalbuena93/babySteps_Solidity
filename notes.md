### Getting funds in rinkeby:
1. Go to https://faucet.rinkeby.io/ and click on the tweeter 3rd party
2. Create a tweet asking for the ETH (including your address)
3. Paste the tweet's url in the input field

### Some Infra

**Mnemonic:** Also known as seedphrase. This gives you access to all your accounts related to a wallet. (For example, *Metamask*)
**Private Key:**  
**Public Key:**

## Proof of Stake

- Works with collateral
- Validators are randomly chosen 

Pros:
1. Uses way less energy since it only works 1 node per block
2. The rest of the nodes just need to verify the block

### ETH proposal
Ethereum 2.0 is proposing to move from a *PoW* to a *PoS* blockchain, to do so it has a random number generator (provided from a Descentralized entity) to select which is gonna be the node to create the block. They are also including the concept of **sharding**, which is the solution of scalability in the blockchain, making -in a way- a blockchain of blockchain

### Developing Solidity

Enter to this link & start coding! Remember that Solidity needs to run on a Javascript VM (at least to do a few tests) or a Testnet

## Using Python
Since python is not the natural language to develop smart contracts, it uses some artifacts & tricks to develop and deploy. As an example, you can go to the [demo notes 101](/demos/web3_py_simple_storage/notes.md) to understand the workflow.
